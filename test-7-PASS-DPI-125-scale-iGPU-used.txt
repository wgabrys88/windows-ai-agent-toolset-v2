NOTE ABOUT THIS SPECIFIC TEST:
This test was performed on non NVIDIA laptop, it has only Intel Iris Xe Graphics,
this is why the speed of execution is slow. The test was observed by human (me)
and I can confirm that the task was performed - OK
- in the end mouse pointer was on the bottom-right area (there is the datetime clock
on the right side of the taskbar - and the mouse pointer was like a little bit to the right and down,
from the top-left corner of that datetime clock "widget") I cannot provide screenshot from this test but
I have verified it by my eyes.
- in the created png files, in the 001 one the cursor was in I shape exactly where i left it before executing command
and running test, in the 002 file the cursor was in that datetime clock area as described earlier

It was run on:
System Windows 11, monitor 1080p, display scale 125% (THIS CONFIRMS DPI AWARENESS MECHANISM - OK)
